- 👋 Hi, I am Anna Ozor.
- 👀 I am a Technical Writer with a background in software engineering. I have proficiency in reading, writing and debugging code written in C#, Python, Java, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, SQL.
- 🌱 Since I have a knack for taking technical concepts and making them understandable to the public, I created a blog https://medium.com/@anna.ozor where I discuss these technical concepts in detail.
- 💞️ I am looking to take on more technical writing projects that will challenge me and help improve user experience for organizations.
- 📫 You can reach me on anna.idongesit@gmail.com
